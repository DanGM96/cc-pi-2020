			Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore
			outer space. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers
			with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted both by
			unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.

			While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates
			reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively
			efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical
			space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring
			space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting
			different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and
			developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.

			“Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered
			by impacts from space, every surviving civilization is obliged to become
			spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic zeal, but for the most
			practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is
			at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to
			other worlds.” ― Carl Sagan
