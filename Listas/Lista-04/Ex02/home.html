        <h1>Space Exploration</h1>
        <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the study of
            space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted
            both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.</p>
        <p>While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was
            the
            development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed
            physical
            space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing
            scientific
            research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and
            developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.</p>
