            <p>
                Location is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates. The location of
                colonization
                can be on a physical body planet, dwarf planet, natural satellite, or asteroid or orbiting one. For
                colonies
                not on a body see also space habitat.

            <h3>Near-Earth space</h3>
            <img class="img-right" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/02/22/08/10/moon-4869803_960_720.jpg"

            <p>
                Due to its proximity and familiarity, Earth's Moon is discussed as a target for colonization. It has the
                benefits of proximity to Earth and lower escape velocity, allowing for easier exchange of goods and
                services. A drawback of the Moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen,
                nitrogen, and carbon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another near-Earth possibility are the five Earth–Moon Lagrange points. Although they would generally
                also
                take a few days to reach with current technology, many of these points would have near-continuous solar
                power because their distance from Earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from
                the
                Sun.

                A space habitat is a type of space station, intended as a permanent settlement rather than as a simple
                way-station or other specialized facility. No space habitat has been constructed yet, but many design
                concepts, with varying degrees of realism, have come both from engineers and from science-fiction
                authors.

            <p>
                Colonizing Mercury would involve similar challenges as the Moon as there are few volatile elements, no
                atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than Earth's. However, the planet also receives almost seven
                times the solar flux as the Earth/Moon system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The colonization of Venus has been a subject of many works of science fiction since before the dawn of
                spaceflight, and is still discussed from both a fictional and a scientific standpoint. However, with the
                discovery of Venus's extremely hostile surface environment, attention has largely shifted towards the
                colonization of the Moon and Mars instead, with proposals for Venus focused on colonies floating in the
                upper-middle atmosphere and on terraforming.

            <p>
                The hypothetical colonization of Mars has received interest from public space agencies and private
                corporations, and has received extensive treatment in science fiction writing, film, and other mediums.
                Organizations have proposed plans for a human mission to Mars, but no person has set foot on the planet.
                However, landers and rovers have successfully explored Mars’ surface and delivered information about
                conditions on the ground.

            <h3>Asteroid belt</h3>
            <p>
                Colonization of asteroids would require space habitats. The asteroid belt has significant overall
                material
                available, the largest object being Ceres, although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region
                of
                space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance, even crossing 500
                million kilometers of space. The colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did
                not
                hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid
                of
                any size.

            <p>
                The Artemis Project designed a plan to colonize Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Scientists were to
                inhabit
                igloos and drill down into the Europan ice crust, exploring any sub-surface ocean. Europa is considered
                one
                of the more habitable bodies in the Solar System and so merits investigation as a possible abode for
                life.

                NASA performed a study called HOPE regarding the future exploration of the Solar System. The target
                chosen
                was Callisto due to its distance from Jupiter, and thus the planet's harmful radiation. It could be
                possible
                to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System.
            </p>
            <p>
                Titan is suggested as a target for colonization, because it is the only moon in the Solar System to have
                a
                dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds. Titan has ice water and large methane oceans.

                Enceladus is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, notable for its extremely bright surface and
                the
                geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. If Enceladus has
                liquid
                water, it joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as one of the prime places in the Solar System to look
                for
                extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.

                Freeman Dyson has proposed that trans-Neptunian objects, rather than planets, are the major potential
                habitat
                of life in space. Several hundred billion to trillion comet-like ice-rich bodies exist outside the orbit
                of
                Neptune, in the Kuiper belt and Inner and Outer Oort cloud. These may contain all the ingredients for
                life
                (water ice, ammonia, and carbon-rich compounds), including significant amounts of deuterium and
                helium-3.
                Since Dyson's proposal, the number of trans-Neptunian objects known has increased greatly.

                Looking beyond the Solar System, there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible
                colonization targets. The main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars: roughly a hundred
                thousand
                times further away than the planets in the Solar System. This means that some combination of very high
                speed
                (some more-than-fractional percentage of the speed of light), or travel times lasting centuries or
                millennia, would be required. These speeds are far beyond what current spacecraft propulsion systems can
                provide.
