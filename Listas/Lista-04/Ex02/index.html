            <h1>Space Exploration</h1>
            <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the study of
                space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though is conducted
                both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight.</p>
            <p>While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was
                the
                development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed
                physical
                space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing
                scientific
                research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and
                developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.</p>
