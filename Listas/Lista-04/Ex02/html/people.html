        <h2>People</h2>
        <p>
            More than 560 people have been trained as astronauts. Until recently, astronauts were sponsored and trained
            exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. However, with the advent
            of suborbital flight starting with privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was
            created: the commercial astronaut.

            The International Space Station has the longest period of continuous human presence in space, 2 November
            2000 to present (19 years and 148 days). This record was previously held by Mir, from Soyuz TM-8 on 5
