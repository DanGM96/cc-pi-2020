        <h2>Secrets</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the unsolved problems in astronomy are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of
            explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that
            there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in
            greater detail. Some unresolved questions in astronomy pertain to one-off events, unusual occurrences that
            have not repeated and whose causes therefore remain unclear.

        <h3>Planetary astronomy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Planetary systems: How does accretion form planetary systems? Where did Earth's water come from?</li>
            <li>Are there any planets beyond Neptune? What is the explanation for the elongated orbits of a group of
                Kuiper belt objects?</li>
            <li>Rotation rate of Saturn: Why does the magnetosphere of Saturn exhibit a (slowly changing) periodicity
                close to that at which the planet's clouds rotate? What is the true rotation rate of Saturn's deep
                interior?</li>

        <h3>Stellar astronomy and astrophysics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Supernovae: What is the exact mechanism by which an implosion of a dying star becomes an explosion?</li>
            <li>p-nuclei: What astrophysical process is responsible for the nucleogenesis of these rare isotopes?</li>
            <li>The Oh-My-God particle and other ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: What physical processes create cosmic
                rays whose energy exceeds the GZK cuttoff?</li>

        <h3>Galactic astronomy and astrophysics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Galaxy rotation problem: Is dark matter responsible for differences in observed and theoretical speed of
                stars revolving around the centre of galaxies, or is it something else</li>
            <li>Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): What powers X-ray sources that are not associated with active
                galactic nuclei but exceed the Eddington limit of a neutron star or stellar black hole? Are they due to
                intermediate mass black holes? Some ULXs are periodic, suggesting non-isotropic emission from a neutron
                star. Does this apply to all ULXs? How could such a system form and remain stable?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Black holes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gravitational singularities: Does general relativity break down in the interior of a black hole due to
                quantum effects, torsion, or other phenomena?</li>
            <li>No-hair theorem: Do black holes have an internal structure? If so, how might the internal structure be
                probed?</li>
            <li>Firewalls: Does a firewall exist around a black hole?</li>

        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark matter: What is the identity of dark matter? Is it a particle? Is it the lightest superpartner
                (LSP)? Do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an
                extension of gravity?</li>
            <li>Baryon asymmetry: Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe?</li>
            <li>Cosmological constant problem: Why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large
                cosmological constant? What cancels it out?</li>
            <li>Hubble tension: If Î›CDM is correct, why are measurements of the Hubble constant failing to converge?

                explanation for the Fermi paradox?</li>
