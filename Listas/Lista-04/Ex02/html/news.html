        <h3>Old Voyager 2 data reveals a gas bubble from Uranus</h3>

            More than 30 years ago, NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft took a 45-hour journey past Uranus. Scientists recently
            revisited Voyager 2's data and found that for one minute on this hours-long trip past the solar system
            giant, the spacecraft recorded a zigzag in the magnetic field readings. This may be a signature of a massive
            bubble of plasma, or charged particles, from Uranus.

            On Thursday (March 26), a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket launched from Space Launch Complex 41 at
            Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to deliver a highly advanced communications satellite for the U.S. Space
            Force. The Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF-6) satellite is the final satellite in the AEHF
            constellation, which comprises six total spacecraft that will orbit 22,200 miles (35,700 kilometers) above
            Earth.

        <h3>Four ESA missions put on standby because of coronavirus concerns</h3>

        <p>
            The European Space Agency (ESA) placed four of its missions on safe and temporary standby amid the ongoing
            spread of coronavirus around the world and calls by local and national governments to scale back on on-site
            personnel. ESA currently has 21 active space missions. The four selected for standby are in stable orbits
            and long mission durations, ESA representatives said.

        <h3>Bigelow Aerospace fired all of its employees</h3>

            Bigelow Aerospace has been developing expandable-habitat technology for two decades. According to recent
            media reports, the Nevada-based company laid off its entire workforce earlier this week. It's not clear if
            the company plans to hire workers back after everything goes back to normal once the coronavirus scare
            recedes, or if the layoffs are permanent.

        <h3>China's Long March 2C delivers military satellites into orbit</h3>

        <p>
            On Tuesday (march 24), China launched three military surveillance satellites into orbit. The payloads
            reached space by hitching a ride on China's Long March 2C rocket, which took off from Xichang Satellite
            Launch Center in China's Sichuan province at 11:43 a.m. local time (0343 GMT; 11:43 p.m. EDT). The country
            has continued to launch rockets throughout the coronavirus outbreak.

        <h3>A NASA employee at Kennedy Space Center tested positive for coronavirus</h3>

            An employee at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida tested positive for the new coronavirus. The
            news follows an announcement from NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine last week that mandated all of the
            space agency's employees (with the exception of critical mission personnel) to work remotely.

        <h3>Earth's year-long visit from a 'minimoon' is over</h3>

            Earth's gravity captured a space rock into our planet's orbit. This ''minimoon'' was called 2020 CD3, and
            was identified last month and astronomers estimated that it had been traveling around Earth for at least a
            year. According to a recent report by The Atlantic, the minimoon likely left Earth's orbit on March 7.

        <h3>Scientists study the ancient neutron star collision that made material in our solar system</h3>

            Astronomers went in search of new information about the ancient cosmic collision that produced material in
            our solar system. Astronomers recently calculated the quantity of radioactive isotopes in the early solar
            system, and then compared their measurements with the amount of isotopes produced by neutron-star mergers.
            Neutron stars are the incredibly-dense stellar corpses that, when they collide, cause ripples in the fabric
            of space-time and produce precious metals like gold, platinum and plutonium.

        <h3>Astronauts give isolation-tips to the public</h3>

            NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson spoke in an interview with CBS This Morning this week and shared what it's like
            to live in isolation. On Monday (March 23), she said isolation is "very doable, but it's very important to
            be able to interact well with the people you're staying with, living with." Whitson has spent a total of 665
            days in space. NASA astronaut Scott Kelly also offered advice in a New York Times op-ed, sharing that
            sticking to a schedule helped a lot.
